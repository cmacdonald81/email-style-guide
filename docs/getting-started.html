  <ol>
    <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="bold">Choose an ESP</span>: Determine which one is the best given the goals of the emails. Refer to the <a href="#ESPs">ESP section</a> for details about each tool.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Write good copy</span>: Refer to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/copy.html">Copy section</a> to write copy that's on-brand.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Create the email within the ESP</span>: If possible, use an existing template within the ESP. These are ready to go and just require editing within the WYSIWYG editor, so they're the fastest option. Need help? Refer to the relevant ESP help sections for guidance: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/mailchimp.html">MailChimp</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/marketo.html">Marketo</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/intercom.html">Intercom</a>, Eloqua (TBD)</li>
    <li><span class="bold">Need something more custom?</span>: If an appropriate one isn't available and you need to create a more custom email, get in touch with a Designer or Developer for help with creating the email.</li>
  </ol>

  <ol>
    <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="bold">Choose an ESP</span>: Choose an ESP. Determine which one is the best given the goals of the emails. Refer to the <a href="#ESPs">ESP section</a> for details about each tool.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Create the email within the ESP</span>: If possible, use an existing template within the ESP. These are ready to go and just require editing within the WYSIWYG editor, so they're the fastest option.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Need something more custom?</span>: If an appropriate one isn't available and you need to create a more custom email, check out the templates already available in the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/templates">Example Templates section</a>. Choose a template that most closely addresses your needs, and if a good match doesn't exist then you can start out with the basic template. The basic template contains all of the atoms and molecules. You can use that as a base and remove the pieces you don't need.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Write good code</span>: Review the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/frontend_guidelines.html">Frontend Guidelines</a> to get a sense of the best practices and get a feel for how the code is structured. Play close attention to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/frontend_guidelines.html#clients">Cross-Email Client Guidelines</a> which will help you develop the most bullet-proof email as possible. Also, be mindful of providing the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/accessibility.html">Accessibility</a> affordances.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use the Email Style Guide as reference</span>: If you need any additional components, refer to the Atoms and Molecules to add them a-la-carte.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Templatize it (optional)</span>: Are you making a recurring email that needs to be edited within an ESP in the future? Refer to the relevant ESP Template Language sections for guidance: <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/mailchimp.html">MailChimp</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/marketo.html">Marketo</a>, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/intercom.html">Intercom</a>, Eloqua (TBD)</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Test it</span>: Developing emails that render well across email clients is a tricky beast. Luckily, our templates have been thoroughly tested to ensure you're being set up for success. That being said, as emails are being tweaked there's always the chance that it could look amiss in a given browser on a certain OS. The goal with testing is to catch these before emails are sent out so that we can confidently send high quality, high performing, on-brand emails.
      <ol>
        <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use well supported CSS</span>: Wherever possible, use CSS that's well supported across email clients, particularly the ones that are in our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/email_client_support.html">Email Client Support chart</a>. Campaign Monitor has a great <a href="http://campaignmonitor.com/css/" target="_blank">chart</a> that displays the CSS support across email clients.</li>
        <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Validate HTML</span>: Run your code through W3C's <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML Validator</a>. The easiest way is to validate it by direct input. Paste all the email code in the text box, click Check, then review the errors. When working with often complicated email code full of nested tables, it's easy to forget a closing tag which can really mess up your layout in some email clients. Pass it through this tool to check for errors.</li>
        <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Review the Cross-Email Client Guidelines</span>: We have Cross-Email Client Guidelines that set you up for success. Refer to the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/email_client_support.html">Email Client Support chart</a> to identify the top clients we support.</li>
        <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Test in Email on Acid</span>: Email on Acid is a handy tool for testing emails across email clients. Use the profile named "Treehouse Email Client Matrix" to test the email against the email clients defined in our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/email_client_support.html">Email Client Support chart</a>.</li>
