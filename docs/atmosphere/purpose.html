    <h3 class="p-b-2-xs">Why do we have an email style guide?</h3>
    <p><span class="bold">Consistency</span> It gives us well defined documentation so everyone who touches emails at Treehouse (and outside agencies we work with) will be on the same page. A consistent email design language which aligns with our brand allows our users to become immersed in the full Treehouse experience. Currently, there are <a href="https://teamtreehouse.invisionapp.com/d/main/#/projects/boards/5407180" target="_blank">inconsistencies</a> in our emails, and this style guide defines the look and feel of our emails going forward.</p>
    <p class="p-t-2-xs"><span class="bold">Efficiency</span> Email design is stereotypically a messy, painful experience. This guide takes the guesswork out of email design to make it an easier process. With the templates and reusable components, you no longer have to reinvent the wheel as you embark on creating an email. Common patterns are already defined, and all you have to do is replace the content. Also, there's no more fighting with inline styles, as the CSS is contained in a central place. And to top it all off, you're able to start with a stable foundation that has already been thoroughly tested in our top <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/atmosphere/email_client_support.html">email clients</a>. Email clients render emails in inconsistent and surprising ways, but no worries—the messy, dirty debugging process has already been done. All this to say—projects will get done quicker than ever, with easy-to-reuse code and less cursing of antiquated email clients.</p>

    <h3 class="p-b-2-xs">How do I use the guide?</h3>
    <p class="p-b-2-xs"><span class="bold">Where to start</span> Whether you're a marketer, designer, developer, salesperson, or agency, this guide is a resource for building emails at Treehouse. There are a few routes you can take, depending on the type of email you're sending and your desire to work within a WYSIWYG editor or with code. The chart below is a guide which helps walk you through the process. It'll help you determine if the email you're creating should belong in Intercom, MailChimp, Marketo, or Mandrill. Specific instructions for how to create it (in the ESP or outside the ESP) follow.</p>

    <h3 class="p-b-2-xs">How is it organized?</h3>
    <p class="p-b-2-xs">The email style guide provides guidelines for the visual alignment of our emails. It uses <a href="https://treehouse.github.io/project-leap" target="_blank">Leap</a> as a guide when possible and deviates from it to address the specific needs of emails. The guide is organized with Atomic Design in mind. There are four main sections: <span class="italic">Atmosphere</span>, <span class="italic">Atoms</span>, <span class="italic">Molecules</span>, and <span class="italic">Templates</span>.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="italic">Atmosphere</span> is the intangible logic that orchestrates the design system. It is broken down into three items:
        <ul>
          <li class="p-t-1-xs"><span class="italic">Vocabulary</span>: Represents what the element is called. It’s name.</li>
          <li class="p-t-1-xs"><span class="italic">Syntax</span>: Speaks to how to use the element, and how it might relate to any other elements</li>
          <li class="p-t-1-xs"><span class="italic">Semantics</span>: Addresses why the element is the way it is and what it should communicate to our users</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="italic">Atoms</span> are individual pieces of <span class="italic">Molecules</span>.</li>
      <li class="p-tb-1-xs"><span class="italic">Molecules</span> are groupings of <span class="italic">Atoms</span> and are common UI patterns which are repeatable across emails</li>
      <li class="p-t-1-xs"><span class="italic">Templates</span> are full examples of common email layouts which can be duplicated and reused.</li>
    </ul>
