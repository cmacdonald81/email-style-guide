If an image is included, it's full bleed within the card (the image is full width and the top part of the image touches the grey background). It includes a &lt;h1&gt; heading which can be a greeting or a title for the announcement. Below that, a paragraph and a button often follows. The announcement / hero molecule has a full width image that spans the left, right, and top sides of the white container. It's followed by a title, paragraph(s) of text, and a button."
