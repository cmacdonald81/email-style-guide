  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Keep the aspect ratio</span>. Don't warp the images. Constrain proportions to retain the aspect ratio of the original image.
  </li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Make it retina-ready</span>. Save images at 2x. This ensures retina-ready images. The images will be scaled down to fit.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Don't use background images</span>. They don't work in Microsoft Outlook or in Gmail.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Plan for text-only emails</span>. Prepare for the emails to be viewed without images. Include alt text that describes the image. Clients such as Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo have images blocked by default, and in other clients users can turn this on in their preferences.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Images can be links</span></li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Keep images under x</span>. Large file sizes take too long to load.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Don't put text in images</span>. Text is put outside images in order to gain control over readability at small screen sizes.</li>
