<h4 class="p-b-1-xs">How to choose the best image type</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use photography when referring to specific people</span>. This will pull the reader in to feel the human element of the story.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use primarily photographs in B2B emails</span>. For B2B emails, use photography over illustrations where possible.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use illustrations to show concepts</span>. Use illustrations to align the email with the Treehouse brand or to communicate concepts that are often hard or not appropriate to visualize through photography.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use GIFs to show product flows</span>. When announcing a new product feature, it's often helpful to show how the feature works. Keep the GIF short so the file size is small. If a longer explanation is needed, use a video.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use videos for campaigns or library content</span>. Use videos produced by Treehouse. This can include campaign videos, teasers, course trailers, and the Dev Team Show.</li>
</ul>

<h4 class="p-t-2-xs p-b-1-xs">General Tips</h4>
<ul>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Keep the aspect ratio</span>. Don't warp the images. Constrain proportions to retain the aspect ratio of the original image.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Make it retina-ready</span>. Save images at 2x. This ensures retina-ready images. The images will be scaled down to fit.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Provide a fallback for background images</span>. Background images don't work in Microsoft Outlook or in Gmail, so provide a background color which is similar to the overall color in the image.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Plan for text-only emails</span>. Prepare for the emails to be viewed without images. Include alt text that describes the image. Clients such as Outlook, AOL, and Yahoo have images blocked by default, and in other clients users can turn this on in their preferences.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Make images link to the CTA when possible</span>. If the image is associated with a CTA, make the image a link to the story-â€”not to the image itself. Images often take up a lot of real estate on the page, so make use of all that clickable space by including a link. People often instinctively try to click images, so make it easy for them to interact with the email.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Keep image file size as small as possible</span>. Large file sizes take too long to load.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Don't put text in images</span>. Text is put outside images in order to gain control over readability at small screen sizes.</li>
  <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Don't include meme GIFs</span>. This makes Treehouse look unprofessional and the GIFs don't conform to our brand guidelines.</li>
