  <h4 class="p-t-4-xs p-b-1-xs">Guidelines</h4>
  <ul>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Don't embed videos directly into emails</span>. Embedded videos aren't widely supported across email clients. Instead, include a video still and then link that picture to the video so that the video plays in a new tab.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Use linked inline image</span>. Add the video still as a regular inline image and wrap it in a link to the video.</li>
    <li class="p-b-1-xs"><span class="bold">Choose eye-catching video stills</span>. Choose a moment in the video that features people (ideally - people are more attracted to images with people) or a catchy visual that represents the gist of the video. Don't choose a frame that includes text. </li>
    <li><span class="bold">Make it look like an app video</span>. Video previews should look like the videos in the Treehouse library. Don't use video previews automatically generated by MailChimp or other ESPs. Use this <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/templates/video-preview.psd">Photoshop template</a> to make the preview. You can use <a href="http://www.youtubescreenshot.com" target="_blank">youtubescreenshot.com</a> to easily generate a video still.</li>
  </ul>
