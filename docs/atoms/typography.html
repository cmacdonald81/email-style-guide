For Paragraph text we use the standard sans-serif font stack which begins with Arial. This ensure optimal readability for text in our emails. It looks like this for headings: <code>font-family: Arial Rounded MT Bold, Helvetica Rounded, Arial, sans-serif;</code> and like this for paragraph text: <code>font-family: Arial, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, sans-serif;</code>"

  syntax = "We use headings to emphasize the most important ideas in an email. We do not use them for long sentences or paragraphs. They should be easy to read and help users quickly identify if an email or section of content is something they are interested in reading. Headings are also ranked in order of importance. So an H1 is should represent the most important item in an email. An H6 the opposite."
  semantics = "Headings in emails allow us to add rhythm and order to our content, especially if an email contains a handful of ideas it needs to communicate. We use headings to greet our readers or identify sections of content."

  semantics = "H2s are going to be the second largest sized type in the email layout. While they are not as large as H1s, their size and boldness will still command the user eye and attention. If you use an H2 it should mean that there are going to be multiple sections of content that relate back to it."

  semantics = "H3s are going to be closer in size to our email paragraph styles because that is what they are visually meant to pair with. Because of that, they will work well to provide readers a visual anchor point for written text."

  syntax = "Use H4s within content areas. Unlike an H3, the H4 should be used when you need to break down a section of content, and it doesn't make sense to create an entirely new section. You should never use an H4 as a heading for an entire section. H4 should be used when an H3 serves at the header for a section of content and you need to organize the content further. Do not use H4s to bold content inline."
  semantics = "H4s are the exact same size as paragraph text. They are this way so that they lend themselves to organizing the lowest level of content. When you use an H4 is means you have a heading for the main section of content already, and you need to provide another level of organization."
