You can vary the contrast to communicate the importance of that section, in relation to the other sections. Topic colors are used when referencing specific topics or courses."
  semantics = "Use color intentionally. If referring to course content, use topic colors wherever it's appropriate. Users often assiciate topics with their associated topic color, so this improves readability and scanability. If only one accent color is needed, choose the brand green."
